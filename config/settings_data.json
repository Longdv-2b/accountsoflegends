Different LoL smurf accounts exist depending on the requirement of the player. The accounts having more essences will cost more than an ordinary smurf account.\n\nIn case you have no idea on what a League of Legends account usually cost, our price range usually starts from $9,99 up to $19,99. A few years ago a basic smurf account with 30.000 essences would cost you over $30 and some places still offer them for such ridiculous prices. Most usually, players like to buy a level 30 LoL account as it isn’t all that expensive but allows them to enjoy most of the activities on the go. On Accounts Of Legends you get LoL Unranked Smurf accounts for only $9,99 and they are completely ready for ranked with the amount of essences on it.\n\nAnother factor on what the account’s pricing might depend on is the current state of the game. To put it bluntly, the relation of pricing of the account follows the same supply and demand rule as all the other items on the market.\n\nThese are mostly the two main factors on what the pricing of the LoL accounts will mostly depend. Luckily, you can find both cheap as well as more expensive accounts on accountsoflegends.com depending on your needs."

              "answer_faqs_pre": "There are a number of different ways on how one can buy League of Legends accounts. All of the ways are completely secure and won’t pose any kind of threat to the player. If you are looking for the safest advice, we recommend that you go for a professional seller that offers a wide service.\n\nBefore you end up buying a LoL Smurfaccount, you will have to keep an eye on the number of services that you are getting on your transaction. For example, you should always check whether you are getting a lifetime warranty on the account or not. Also make sure that the account is unverified. That means you can change email and password. This way, nobody else will ever have access to your account and in the rare case of being hacked or forgetting your log in details, you can easily recover your account using your email.\n\nThese are all the main factors that you will need to check before getting the account. This will help you to determine exactly how reliable or good the source is from where you are making your purchase. Another thing to look out for is the customer support. Is email support offered or maybe even a professional live chat support? If there is a live chat, make use of it and get all the information you need.\n\nOne thing that you will need to absolutely avoid is going for an unreasonable cheap account from a random website without reputation. Sadly, some places sell verified, banned or even hacked accounts. Instead, you need to make sure that the source or website from where you are getting your LoL Account should be completely safe and reliable at all costs. It may cost you a few more bucks, but it is better than the account which might get banned or stop working after a certain period time. This is why it is crucial that you don’t just end up buying from a completely random website."

Start with checking your account for any type of issues. If you notice anything wrong with the account, we strongly recommend that you contact us so we can have a look. If you don’t know what things to check, you will have to check things like the Server, Essences, Status of the account, and whether it has been previously used or not.\n\nThe format of the account is always as to mention the name of the player followed by the password and the server. After you have confirmed that there is nothing wrong with your account, you should immediately change the email, and the password of the account in order to completely secure it. To do this, you will have to access the League’s website.\n\nAfter you launch the game, we suggest going to a custom game and adjusting the settings of your game. Some of the most important settings include:\n\nVideo – Enable line missile display (for skillshots!)\n\nInterface - Turn on Chat as well as timestamps.\n\nInterface - Turn on Gold, Mana, Damage, Heal, Mana, and similar settings (at the bottom).\n\nSounds – Unmute\n\nGame – Turn off movement prediction (at the bottom).\nOnce you are done with adjusting the game’s settings, we suggest buying 20 different champions to use in ranked. Lastly, change your in-game name. You should now be set to enjoying your level 30 LoL unranked smurf account. Just make sure that you follow all these instructions, so you don’t end up facing any type of issues in the future."

Different LoL smurf accounts exist depending on the requirement of the player. The accounts having more essences will cost more than an ordinary smurf account. In case you have no idea on what a League of Legends account usually cost, our price range usually starts from $9,99 up to $19,99. A few years ago a basic smurf account with 30.000 essences would cost you over $30 and some places still offer them for such ridiculous prices. Most usually, players like to buy a level 30 LoL account as it isn’t all that expensive but allows them to enjoy most of the activities on the go. On Accounts Of Legends you get LoL Unranked Smurf accounts for only $9,99 and they are completely ready for ranked with the amount of essences on it. Another factor on what the account’s pricing might depend on is the current state of the game. To put it bluntly, the relation of pricing of the account follows the same supply and demand rule as all the other items on the market. These are mostly the two main factors on what the pricing of the LoL accounts will mostly depend. Luckily, you can find both cheap as well as more expensive accounts on accountsoflegends.com depending on your needs."

              "answer_faqs_technical": "There are a number of different ways on how one can buy League of Legends accounts. All of the ways are completely secure and won’t pose any kind of threat to the player. If you are looking for the safest advice, we recommend that you go for a professional seller that offers a wide service. Before you end up buying a LoL Smurfaccount, you will have to keep an eye on the number of services that you are getting on your transaction. For example, you should always check whether you are getting a lifetime warranty on the account or not. Also make sure that the account is unverified. That means you can change email and password. This way, nobody else will ever have access to your account and in the rare case of being hacked or forgetting your log in details, you can easily recover your account using your email. These are all the main factors that you will need to check before getting the account. This will help you to determine exactly how reliable or good the source is from where you are making your purchase. Another thing to look out for is the customer support. Is email support offered or maybe even a professional live chat support? If there is a live chat, make use of it and get all the information you need. One thing that you will need to absolutely avoid is going for an unreasonable cheap account from a random website without reputation. Sadly, some places sell verified, banned or even hacked accounts. Instead, you need to make sure that the source or website from where you are getting your LoL Account should be completely safe and reliable at all costs. It may cost you a few more bucks, but it is better than the account which might get banned or stop working after a certain period time. This is why it is crucial that you don’t just end up buying from a completely random website."

Start with checking your account for any type of issues. If you notice anything wrong with the account, we strongly recommend that you contact us so we can have a look. If you don’t know what things to check, you will have to check things like the Server, Essences, Status of the account, and whether it has been previously used or not. The format of the account is always as to mention the name of the player followed by the password and the server. After you have confirmed that there is nothing wrong with your account, you should immediately change the email, and the password of the account in order to completely secure it. To do this, you will have to access the League’s website. After you launch the game, we suggest going to a custom game and adjusting the settings of your game. Some of the most important settings include: Video – Enable line missile display (for skillshots!) Interface - Turn on Chat as well as timestamps. Interface - Turn on Gold, Mana, Damage, Heal, Mana, and similar settings (at the bottom). Sounds – Unmute Game – Turn off movement prediction (at the bottom). Once you are done with adjusting the game’s settings, we suggest buying 20 different champions to use in ranked. Lastly, change your in-game name. You should now be set to enjoying your level 30 LoL unranked smurf account. Just make sure that you follow all these instructions, so you don’t end up facing any type of issues in the future."

Wins and losses are likely the biggest factors, but other important statistics could be the player’s KDA, CS per minute, and average gold per minute. The game changes a player's MMR after each match, and more played games usually mean more accurate results. To avoid misrepresentation of the rating, premade matches are not taken into consideration because of the difference in their MMR's. Another thing about these estimates that this rating represents is the fact that it takes into consideration only games from a certain game mode in the last 30 days. \nMMR also affects your LP gains and losses in Ranked Queues and determines your teammates and opponents, so a lot of players have become more curious about it. One thing you should know is that dodging games in any mode doesn't affect your MMR in that mode, even though you are punished with losing 3 LP if you dodge a Ranked match. Because your MMR directly affects your LP gains and losses in Ranked, a lot of players want to improve it in any way possible, but the truth is, the only way to improve your MMR is to just win more games based on your performance. \nWe already know that MMR is not visible for players in the League Client, only the actual rank they achieved in the Ranked Mode. But what about the MMR in other modes such as ARAM? Luckily, various unofficial sites can calculate a rough estimation for a player’s MMR in different modes, and soon we are going to be a part of them!",

Ranked Solo\/Duo reflects the progress they have made through the ranking system in the form of gaining and losing League Points(LP).\n But there is a large population of the player community that usually avoids the Ranked Solo\/Duo Queue for various reasons. Some of these reasons are that some players are just not that competitive and take the game more lightly. Some players face anxiety from the possibility of losing LP or being criticized by teammates for various reasons.

Different LoL smurf accounts exist depending on the requirement of the player. The accounts having more essences will cost more than an ordinary smurf account. In case you have no idea on what a League of Legends account usually cost, our price range usually starts from $9,99 up to $19,99. A few years ago a basic smurf account with 30.000 essences would cost you over $30 and some places still offer them for such ridiculous prices. Most usually, players like to buy a level 30 LoL account as it isn’t all that expensive but allows them to enjoy most of the activities on the go. On Accounts Of Legends you get LoL Unranked Smurf accounts for only $9,99 and they are completely ready for ranked with the amount of essences on it. Another factor on what the account’s pricing might depend on is the current state of the game. To put it bluntly, the relation of pricing of the account follows the same supply and demand rule as all the other items on the market. These are mostly the two main factors on what the pricing of the LoL accounts will mostly depend. Luckily, you can find both cheap as well as more expensive accounts on accountsoflegends.com depending on your needs."

All of the ways are completely secure and won’t pose any kind of threat to the player. If you are looking for the safest advice, we recommend that you go for a professional seller that offers a wide service. Before you end up buying a LoL Smurfaccount, you will have to keep an eye on the number of services that you are getting on your transaction. For example, you should always check whether you are getting a lifetime warranty on the account or not. Also make sure that the account is unverified. That means you can change email and password. This way, nobody else will ever have access to your account and in the rare case of being hacked or forgetting your log in details, you can easily recover your account using your email. These are all the main factors that you will need to check before getting the account. This will help you to determine exactly how reliable or good the source is from where you are making your purchase. Another thing to look out for is the customer support. Is email support offered or maybe even a professional live chat support? If there is a live chat, make use of it and get all the information you need. One thing that you will need to absolutely avoid is going for an unreasonable cheap account from a random website without reputation. Sadly, some places sell verified, banned or even hacked accounts. Instead, you need to make sure that the source or website from where you are getting your LoL Account should be completely safe and reliable at all costs. It may cost you a few more bucks, but it is better than the account which might get banned or stop working after a certain period time.

The format of the account is always as to mention the name of the player followed by the password and the server. After you have confirmed that there is nothing wrong with your account, you should immediately change the email, and the password of the account in order to completely secure it. To do this, you will have to access the League’s website. After you launch the game, we suggest going to a custom game and adjusting the settings of your game. Some of the most important settings include: Video – Enable line missile display (for skillshots!) Interface - Turn on Chat as well as timestamps. Interface - Turn on Gold, Mana, Damage, Heal, Mana, and similar settings (at the bottom). Sounds – Unmute Game – Turn off movement prediction (at the bottom). Once you are done with adjusting the game’s settings, we suggest buying 20 different champions to use in ranked. Lastly, change your in-game name. You should now be set to enjoying your level 30 LoL unranked smurf account. Just make sure that you follow all these instructions, so you don’t end up facing any type of issues in the future."

It ensures that each player has the needed skill and knowledge to compete in various matches and that a novice is not pitted against more experienced players with superior knowledge (for example Platinum 2 against Diamond 1). Respectively, being Diamond 1 does not mean you only play against Diamond 1 players. Chances are that you are smurfing and have a 70%+ win rate. In this case, your hidden MMR would be much higher you’re your actual rank Diamond 1. If your MMR is higher than your actual rank, you will play against players of a higher elo, but you also win a lot more LP. Your LP gain or loss is always determined by your hidden MMR. Having a higher MMR than your actual rank leads to a higher LP gain and lower LP loss while having a lower MMR than your actual rank leads to a lower LP gain and higher LP loss. In this way, the MMR is trying to move people to their actual rank as quickly as possible. While MMR can be really confusing, it is also a really important number to understand if you are seriously trying to improve your rank. That’s why we decided to dive deep into everything you need to know about the LoL MMR system, how it works, and how to improve it!\n<br><br>"

Nothing else affects a player's MMR. Not even stats like gold per minute, kills, deaths, and assists (KDAs), or creep score (CS) per minute. It's essential to understand that just a win will boost your MMR and a defeat will lower it.\n<br> \nExpect +10 MMR points for each win and -10 MMR points for each loss (not LP!). Because LP is solely used to determine your rank on the leaderboard, getting as many points as possible is critical, especially because your MMR in LoL is always hidden but directly impacts your LP gains.\n<br>\nKeep in mind that a player's metrics are calculated after all games have been completed. In addition, the MMR tracker only considers the previous 30 days of records. This means that an MMR calculator will only return results if your account has enough games in the last 30 days. It is not possible for us, to calculate your MMR if your account hasn't been active in the last 30 days.\n<br><br>"

This leads to you being matched with lower elo players.\n<br>\nIf your LP gains are high (24+LP) you can be sure that your MMR is good and you should continue climbing without issues. The game will match you with higher ranked people because your MMR indicates that you deserve a higher rank. \n<br>\nIf you are still unsure if your MMR is good or bad, you can use MMR trackers and calculators like ours. Simply choose your ser-ver (NA, EUW, EUNE, KR) and type in your account name. After that, you will get a detailed report of your MMR.

              "textarea1": "Simply put, the only way to improve your MMR is to win. Your MMR increases when you win a game. When you lose a game, your MMR drops. Unfortunately, a big losing streak will decrease your MMR more than a long win streak would increase your MMR. That’s why it is important to play well and win consistently without long losing streaks.\n<br><br>\n\nAfter long losing streaks, many people experienced really low LP gains, and even after a long win streak, they could not recover their MMR in order to get better LP gains. That’s why a great way to improve your MMR is to take a step back from your main account and play on a smurf. Smurfing is a good way to practice new things and you have the chance to really focus on improving your gameplay. These days you don’t even have to level a LoL smurf account yourself anymore, you can easily\n\n<a style=\"text-decoration:underline;\" href=\"https:\/\/accountsoflegends.com\/products\/lol-smurfs?variant=32122710032472\">buy Level 30 LoL unranked smurf accounts<\/a> \n\nthat are ready for ranked \n\n<a style=\"text-decoration:underline;\" href=\"https:\/\/accountsoflegends.com\/products\/lol-smurfs?variant=32122710032472\">on our site<\/a>.

If you play with higher MMR players you will also be matched with higher MMR players. This can quickly boost your MMR if you win a lot of games with that duo partner. On the other hand, your duo partner would have to take a step back in MMR since he will be playing with lower MMR players to meet a relatively fair MMR average between both teams.\n<br><br>\n\nAnother way to improve your MMR is abusing the meta. You might have heard of terms like “meta slave” which refers to people only playing what is strong at the moment. These players will instantly drop a champ if a nerf was released or the new hot thing comes out. However, sticking to the meta will statistically improve your MMR. A wise man once said: “Monkey sees Malphite 58% win-rate, Monkey plays Malphite.”\n<br><br>\n\nARAM can help you improve your skill, and winning ARAMs can help you improve your ARAM MMR, but there are no ARAM ranks since there is no ARAM leader board. In Solo and Duo ranked games, ARAM MMR has no bearing on the real rank. But as stated, we think that playing ARAM can really improve your understanding of the game and champions in LoL, and it can teach you important team-fighting lessons. To advance in ranked games, you must polish your skills, which ARAM gameplay can help you do. You can use an MMR calculator to get a better idea of how far you've actually come.\n<br><br>\n\nSometimes it is just important to keep a clear head and not get too emotional playing the game. Because you can enhance your scoreboard rating by winning or losing LP in ranked Solo and Duo matches, it can be nerve-wracking or fiercely competitive. Some gamers aren't serious about the game and are simply looking for a way to pass the time. They have no desire to become professional gamers or to be concerned about leaderboards. Others are simply unconcerned with the tension of league games and the possibility of losing league points and MMR. It's useful to be aware of the various player demographics and where they go to play games. Depending on where you're looking for matches, you could be dealing with a wide range of people who will either employ every trick in the book or refuse to look at the screen at all. Not all people might be as dedicated as you.\n<br><br>\n\nDon’t rage queue. Rage queue refers to queueing up even after losing many games in a row and you’re really frustrated. This usually leads to even longer losing streaks and a massive drop in your performance. If you noticed that you lost a lot of games recently it is recommended to take a step back. Play some other game modes like ARAM or normals where you can take it easy and get back on track. A common practice from experienced players is getting a new LoL smurf account to practice ranked games without having to worry about losing on your main account.\n<br><br>\n\nIf you can’t win it, dodge it\nIf you avoid a game that you believe you can't win and then find a different lobby that you can win, you'll still end up with a net LP gain without putting your MMR at risk. If you had played that game and lost, you would have lost both: LP and MMR. You only lose -3 LP but not MMR if you dodge. In League of Legends, your MMR is only updated after you complete a game.\n<br>\nBy doing a quick op.gg check on your team you can also see if you’re playing with decent people or if you have bad players or even trolls in your team. To do that, simply copy all names from the champ select, and paste them into op.gg at once (do that by copying the text “player 1 joined the lobby, player 2 joined the lobby” etc. OP.GG will automatically filter the names out and provide you a list with all stats for all players at the same time) This will instantly show you the win rates and the past 10 games of all players on one page. If you see people having a 30% win rate or people lost the last 6 games you should consider dodging. This will keep your MMR safe from an almost guaranteed loss.\n<br><br> <br>"

But there are also other factors to take care of since you don’t just lose LP by dodging but you risk getting long time penalties if you dodge too often.\n<br>\nWhen you win ranking games, you gain LP. If things don't go as planned, you lose some of your LP. Dodging is an important factor to consider. If you dodge a LoL match for the first time within 24 hours, you will lose 3 LP.

              "textarea1": "Whether you believe the Smurfing practice is unjust or merely a way to have some fun, MMRs or governance do not prevent smurfing. They can, however, assist you in identifying Smurfs based on their metrics.\n<br>\nWhile a Smurf might theoretically be banned, this never really happens in practice because Smurfs are separated into a different ranked queue known as “smurf queue”.\n<br>\nSmurfs have skewed metrics in general, which may be easily identified by comparing actual rank to MMR. It's most certainly a Smurf if the actual rank on the leaderboard displayed is gold while the MMR is platinum.\n<br>\nRiot Games decided to address the Smurf problem in games by introducing a Smurf Queue, which pits Smurfs against one another.\n<br>\nIt's worth noting that, while many people think of Smurfing as a terrible thing, this isn't always the case. There are legitimate reasons for a user to create a new profile in order to join friends who have only recently begun playing a game. \n<br>\nIn games, you can expect Smurfing to persist for a while, and you'll have to adjust to the actual (rather than theoretical) gameplay and rank. The last thing a Smurf wants to do is face another Smurf, but thanks to some clever Riot Games design, this is quite likely to happen due to the creation of the smurf queue.\n<br><br>"
